# React + Vite

This project is a responsive navigation bar built using React and Vite. It includes both desktop and mobile navigation menus with smooth animations and state management.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with a desktop menu and a mobile sliding menu.
- **Smooth Animations**: Implemented using Tailwind CSS for transitions and animations.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` hook to toggle the mobile menu.
- **Reusable Components**: Includes modular components like `Header`, `MobileHeader`, and `NavLinks` for scalability.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Navigation links are dynamically rendered from a data source.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **React Icons**: For modern and accessible icons.

## File Structure

- `src/components/Header.jsx`: The base version of the header component, providing the foundation for navigation.
- `src/components/PositionHeader.jsx`: A header designed for transitioning between small screens and full screens. It uses a fixed position and includes a sliding menu bar for mobile views.
- `src/components/MobileHeader.jsx`: A mobile-specific header where the navigation links are located at the bottom of the screen for better accessibility on small devices.
- `src/components/NavLinks.jsx`: Renders navigation links dynamically for reuse across desktop and mobile menus.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

## Future Improvements

- Add more accessibility features like `aria-labels` for better screen reader support.
- Implement active link highlighting for better navigation feedback.
- Optimize animations for performance on low-end devices.
